# Automated strain separation of low-complexity metagenomes

Strainberry is a method that performs strain separation in low-complexity metagenomes using error-prone long-read technologies. 
It exploits state-of-the-art tools for variant calling, haplotype phasing, and genome assembly, in order to
achieve single-sample assembly of strains with higher quality than other state-of-the-art long-read assemblers.

## System requirements

Strainberry has been developed and tested under a Linux environment.
It requires certain packages/tools in order to be installed/used: 
+ The bash shell
+ [miniconda3](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
+ Standard development packages:
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `build-essential` and `python3-dev`
    - RedHat/CentOS/Fedora: `gcc`, `gcc-c++`, `glibc-devel`, `make`, and `python3-devel`

## Installation

The simplest (and recommended) way to install Strainberry dependencies is by creating an isolated conda environment (*e.g.*, named sberry):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rvicedomini/strainberry.git
$ cd strainberry
$ conda env create -n sberry --file environment.yml
```

To make the `strainberry` command available, it is advised to include the absolute path of Strainberry's directory in your PATH environment variable by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
$ export PATH=/absolute/path/to/strainberry:${PATH}
```

### Updating to the latest version

``` 
$ cd strainberry
$ git pull
$ conda env update -n sberry --file environment.yml
```

## Usage

Activate the conda environment:

```
$ conda activate sberry
```

Running Strainberry:

```
$ strainberry [options] -r <FASTA> -b <BAM> -o <OUTPUT_DIR>
```

where `<FASTA>` is a *strain-oblivious* metagenome assembly (*e.g.*, generated with metaFlye) 
and `<BAM>` is a *coordinate-sorted* alignment of long reads in BAM format. 
Strainberry output sequences are be stored in `<OUTPUT_DIR>`

After Strainberry execution the conda environment can be deactivated:

```
$ conda deactivate
```

## Output files

The output directory of Strainberry has the following structure:

```
OUTPUT_DIR/
├── 00-preprocess/
├── 10-variants/
├── 20-separation/
├── 30-assembly/
├── 50-sascf/
├── assembly.contigs.fa
└── assembly.scaffolds.fa
```

Strainberry output assemblies are stored in the `assembly.contigs.fa` and `assembly.scaffolds.fa` files.
As usual, the contigs assembly is more conservative while the scaffolds assembly is more contiguous. 
In the contig assembly headers are of the form:

```
>sberry|[reference-name]_[phaseset-id]_h[haplotype]_[contig-index]
```

All the other sub-directories in Strainberry's output contain intermediate results and log files.
Therefore, after a successful run of Strainberry, they could be deleted.

## Example

In order to verify that Strainberry works properly, it is possible to run it on a small dataset in the `example` sub-directory.

### Generating the input from the reads
In order to generate a strain-oblivious assembly and a read alignment, we recommend to use metaFlye, minimap2, and samtools.
Assuming these tools are available, it is possible to run the following commands, using 12 threads:

```
$ cd example
$ flye --meta --pacbio-raw reads.fq.gz --out-dir flye_out --genome-size 300k --threads 12
$ minimap2 -ax map-pb -t 12 ./flye_out/assembly.fasta reads.fq.gz | samtools sort >./flye_out/alignment.sorted.bam
```

where `--genome-size` provides an estimate of the metagenome to metaFlye.
The assembly and read alignment are then available in the `flye_out` directory as `assembly.fasta` and `alignment.sorted.bam` respectively.

### Running Strainberry
Given the provided `assembly.fasta` and `alignment.sorted.bam` files, it is possible to run Strainberry using 4 threads as follows:

```
$ cd example
$ strainberry -r assembly.fasta -b alignment.sorted.bam -o sberry_out -t 4
```

Strainberry should take around 5 minutes to finish. The file `assembly.fasta` contains a single sequence which is a consensus of a small region of *E. coli* strains K12 and W.
After a successful run of Strainberry, in the `sberry_out` directory, the file `assembly.scaffolds.fa` should contain two scaffolds (one closer to strain K12, the other closer to strain W).
