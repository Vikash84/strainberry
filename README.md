# Automated strain separation of low-complexity metagenomes

Strainberry is a method that performs strain separation in low-complexity metagenomes using error-prone long-read technologies. 
It exploits state-of-the-art tools for variant calling, haplotype phasing, and genome assembly, in order to
achieve single-sample assembly of strains with higher quality than other state-of-the-art long-read assemblers.

## System requirements

+ Strainberry has been developed and tested under a Linux environment
+ The bash shell should be installed
+ To easily install Strainberry dependencies, [miniconda3](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is strongly recommended

### Installation

The recommended way to install Strainberry is through an isolated environment built with conda (*e.g.*, named sberry):
```
git clone https://github.com/rvicedomini/strainberry.git
cd strainberry
conda env create -n sberry --file environment.yml
```

It is advised to include Strainberry directory in your PATH environment variable by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```
export PATH=/path/to/strainberry:${PATH}
```

## Usage

Activate the conda environment:
```
$ conda activate sberry
```

Running Strainberry:
```
$ strainberry [options] -r <FASTA> -b <BAM> -o <OUTPUT_DIR>
```
where `<FASTA>` is a *strain-oblivious* metagenome assembly (*e.g.*, generated with metaFlye) 
and `<BAM>` is a *coordinate-sorted* alignment of long reads in BAM format. 
Strainberry output sequences will be stored in `<OUTPUT_DIR>/assembly.{contigs,scaffolds}.fa`

After Strainberry execution the conda environment can be deactivated:
```
$ conda deactivate sberry
```

### Test dataset

In order to verify that Strainberry works properly, it is possible to run it on a small dataset in the `example` sub-directory:
```
$ cd example
$ strainberry -r ecoli.fa -b ecoli.sorted.bam -o sberry_out -t 4
```
Strainberry should take around 5 minutes to finish. The input is a small fragment of a consensus *E. coli* sequence.
In the `sberry_out` output directory, both `assembly.contigs.fa` and `assembly.scaffolds.fa` FASTA files should contain two sequences
(one closer to strain K12, the other closer to strain W).

### Command line options

```
$ strainberry --help
